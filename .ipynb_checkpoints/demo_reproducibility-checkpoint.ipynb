    "## Demonstration of reproducibility and deployability of the computational workflow of the article \"Profiling the baseline performance and limits of machine learning models for adaptive immune receptor repertoire classification\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the original article (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.23.445346), the findings were based on reading in ~ 2 TB of data and writing to disk ~ 10 TB of data. Note that the main purpose of this document is only to demonstrate the ease of re-usability and reproducibility of the containerized computational workflow of this article. Therefore, we feed a very small toy dataset to each of the analysis scripts tested in this document and reduced the number of cross-validation loops, iterations to reduce the running time for this demonstration. **Thus, the findings in this document will not make any sense - but should reflect the fact that the containerized computational workflow of this manuscript is well-functioning and hence re-usable, deployable across computational environments.**"
