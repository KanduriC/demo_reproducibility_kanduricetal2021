    "> In the original article (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.23.445346), the findings were based on reading in ~ 2 TB of data and writing to disk ~ 10 TB of data. Note that the main purpose of this document is only to demonstrate the ease of re-usability and reproducibility of the containerized computational workflow of this article. Therefore, we feed a very small toy dataset to each of the analysis scripts tested in this document and reduced the number of cross-validation loops, iterations to reduce the running time for this demonstration. **Thus, the findings in this document will not make any sense - but should reflect the fact that the containerized computational workflow of this manuscript is well-functioning and hence re-usable, deployable across computational environments.**"

    "- In the original manuscript (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.23.445346), the findings were organized into 10 heatmaps. In each heatmap, one particular variable property of AIRR-ML model training setup was explored (y-axis of heatmaps) at different witness rates (x-axis). These analyses were specified using a configurable YAML specification files, where for each experiment only the properties that are of interest are varied while other parameters remained the same. **Therefore, it would be sufficient to test the re-usability, reproducibility and deployability of the computational environment by re-running and producing output from one cell of each heatmap.** In the original manuscript, to gauge uncertainty, we repeated each analysis 3 times on separate datasets. However, here we re-run each cell only one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Below, under each sub-heading (matching the descriptions of the manuscript), we re-run one cell of each heatmap on toy data (the output of which will make no sense as explained above). To check the reproducibility on your machine, clone this github repository and make sure that the **analyses** directory is empty before re-running the code snippets below either in a terminal or from this jupyter notebook. Note that jupyter notebook uses \"!\" symbol for running command-line commands. If you instead run these commands directly in a terminal, the \"!\" symbol has to be removed from the code snippets below.\n",

    "- The stdout and stderr of each analysis snippet below are redirected to respective analysis directories of each jupyter notebook cell and only an output file from each analysis is printed to indicate successful execution.
